Program "game of sticks" so that two AI's play eachother in game of sticks at leasst 100 times, where after each round, both AI's have learned from their previous moves. 
If they make a move that causes them to win, their odds of choosing that moveat the given scenario (amount of sticks on the table), increases. 
If they lose, then their odds of choosing each move at the given scenario decreases or remains the same. Once the AI is trained, a human plays against it and is challenged 
because the AI makes the best moves possible.
